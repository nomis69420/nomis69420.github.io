        Date a Live IV is the fourth sequel to the anime Date A Live IV, I'll be honest I didn't have high hopes thought it was another cliche anime yk the ones harem, accidentally touches boob,girl thinks he's cheating etc etc first ep and I comment that I forgot everything
        that had happened in the other seasons and it's true people say that op slaps hard so I'll listen to it later and with the anime holy shit animation was never this good was it? And this new girl, honestly she isn't so bad not like any other girls and at the end of the 
        ep she said she only likes 2D lmao onto next ep forgot to mentions first episode had a few little jokes and had a chuckle here and there next episode is where they all try to make a doughjin or whatever to make Mia read it and essentially fall in love with the MC and I 
        still can't get over this animation like goddamn So 3rd episode we see them competing in this manga who-sells-more content both tie but she stills reads cause he tried and she gets moved by it then Ike and his harem makes her go inverted because the moment she opened up
        to Shido she remembered the 5 years of pain in that lab. Ike harem sliced her and takes the crystals from her and Ike uses it to gets her power which can I say that is amazing? Like a villain who is actually formidable? Then they leave with her power mc kisses Nia and there 
        it ends at the end of the episode they are talking about when she got turned into a spirit and said all spirits were human at one point right?</h3>
