      <h3 class="s1">Up to now I thought the people who were reviewing anime and writing that the characters were to "shallow" and just 
      thought they were just talking out of their ass but now I fully understand what they meant. This anime is the definition of confusing 
      and just straight up boring so I decided I would watch it just because I wanted to watch some trashy Isekai anime for the heck of it 
      and this anime came into mind starts off with this "demon lord" saying that he's so powerful that all of his comrades don't see him eye 
      to eye and so he wants to reincarnate so he would be treated the same as other people? I forgot. So yada yada he gets this elf girl 
      and succubus and ofc they are drooling all over MC I don't really care but it's just their action lke they are so annoying and once a 
      villain appears literally defeats him with 2 moves and they dont get in ANY details on what happens for example the stupid shape ranks 
      which was talked about in the first 3 episodes and forgot about it as the anime moved on and his 2nd form which he just gets and absolutly 
      explaination. 
      </h3> 
      <h3 class="s1d">All in all wouldn't recommend to anyone unless they specifically ask for a trash anime also some comments on the site I was 
      watching with said that it was the best anime they've watched this year. I can't tell if they are joking or not ://
      </h3>
      <h3 class="s2">N/A - And hope it stays that way.</h3>
