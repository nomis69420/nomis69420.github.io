        Magi: The Kingdom Of Magic has been on my watchlist for a few months now and I decided to watch it. Starts off where magi is overpowered as hell and 
        I'll just do a quick rundown on what happened, the princess dualed with sinbad and magi and the red hair girled and the prince went on a ship journey
        red hair girl is going to her homeland prince is idk. Alibaba is going to be coliseum to be more powerful magi is going to be stronger by going to a village 
        as they were about to arrived at the port, red hair girl sees fire in the port, then someone floating comes and demands for the stuff on the ship and 
        makes two ships float beside the ship all four were on and said they wer pirates. They have alladin as a hostage and succesfully got away with the loot from
        Sinbad's trading ship, later we find out they are kipnapping kids and adopt them with the loot they gained the other friends come to save Alladin, they 
        arrive and the prince is mad at Alababa because he thinks he was the one who destoryed his kingdom and took his mother or smt, as the enemy were running away 
        they get surronded by the naval ships and are attacked they get captured and then the prince executes her.
