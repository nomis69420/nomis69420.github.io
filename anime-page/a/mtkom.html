        Magi: The Kingdom Of Magic has been on my watchlist for a few months now and I decided to watch it. Starts off where magi is overpowered as hell and 
        I'll just do a quick rundown on what happened, the princess dualed with sinbad and magi and the red hair girled and the prince went on a ship journey
        red hair girl is going to her homeland prince is idk. Alibaba is going to be coliseum to be more powerful magi is going to be stronger by going to a village 
        as they were about to arrived at the port, red hair girl sees fire in the port, then someone floating comes and demands for the stuff on the ship and 
        makes two ships float beside the ship all four were on and said they wer pirates. They have alladin as a hostage and succesfully got away with the loot from
        Sinbad's trading ship, later we find out they are kipnapping kids and adopt them with the loot they gained the other friends come to save Alladin, they 
        arrive and the prince is mad at Alababa because he thinks he was the one who destoryed his kingdom and took his mother or smt, as the enemy were running away 
        they get surronded by the naval ships and are attacked they get captured and then the prince executes her. Prince guy talks to the pirates and says that they 
        were just being used after he is seen about to go off on his own the red hair girl is there to ask him to not go and he confesses and they kiss imo he's 
        my favorite character. Goofy name cries as he asks the pirate to go to Sindria. All three are eating and they make a promsise to meet again. The boys goes 
        club. Goofy name meets ugly girl again. F for goofy name. The next day they are ready to leave and we see Alladin go on his carpet he get's tired and see's 
        carriage he asks to get on, he gives them ALL of his money from Sinbad and later we find out he's in the same carriage as the prince of the Koi Empire they 
        the prince has the power to make his sword like 10x bigger. He get's to the academy and he's the lowest 6 class and all he does is body training he survives 
        and he is more powerful we are then explained all 8 power thingies and he got fire power as his main and wind as his secoundar, tomorrow is the day for test 
        everyone is scared. Alladin goes and does a combination of fire and wind and gets promoted from bottom 6 class to top 1 class.Thanks to instructers boob :> 
        Next we see Goofy name, he is down on his lucks while he was traveling with his ship priates came along and he defended them the crew was actually on the same
        side as the pirates and so got Goofy name drunk then cleaned him out, he's out in the city and begging for food he then makes up his mind to go to the colosseum
        to become a gladiator he goes there and a girl is there asks for a entry mail or smt but he got cleaned out so she challenges him for entry gets his butt kicked
        since he's so hungry and then get's blasted off like team rocket where we see the 3 amigos (brothers) from S1 and they have a casino and they let him in while
        there he eats up and meets the master of the colosseum battles his apprentice (the girl from earlier) and wins he is now going to the colosseum to battle where
        they find out that there is two kind of ruth inside of him and if it continues it will damage his internal organs and now he needs to pay it off, so he is off 
        to fight the gorilla thingy that has taken the lives of 100 other gladiators. After getting beat hard by the gorilla he beats him and then one of his spirit thingies
        disappears uses the money to release the monster he talks with the master aout something then red girl is going to her homeland she meets the stupi king from the other 
        kingdom and his brother they are studying a groyp of people for Sindria because their language is seen alot in dungeons. Red hair is going to her homeland she has to 
        cross a valley and so she does by getting down with her chain then running when she reeachs the ground, she runs until she finds a house inside is the "guardian" of 
        valley and says he can bring her to her homeland but she can't comeback. Also he says the world will fall into a destructive war. At the Koi Empire the emperor died 
        all of his kids are going to respect him theyre the annouce the next ruler which is the wife. Homie says he respect her but in truth will kill her i think and explains 
        his big plain to his sister. But she says she have to think about it. Then we see the Magi and the empress (bitch) and they have a little fight and Homie loses Magi says 
        if he were to direct his anger to his destiny he would gladed take him. Next Alladin we see him at a ceremony where he is on par with someone in the class 1 thing 
        When other guy asked if Alladin wanted to be friends but Alladin proceeds to roast him about his high voice and his butt is big and touched his chest for boobs 
        but he's a guy. Then the ruler of the place their at says they need to have a duel because advanced magic is something and only one of them is allowed to be 
        educated. They are sparing and they rip off each other's sleeves revealing the stone that Alladin was supposed to keep away at all cost but he also had one 
        in his arms. The ruler came down and declared the match is a draw. Alladin tried talking to him but other guy took his hand and was about to kill Alladin for 
        he will be problem in his mission the leader stops it and Alladin is in a bed healing while other guy is in solitude. Near the end we see him talking to someone 
        on his arms. The queen (or princess) where Alibaba is at. (end of ep 13) Titus later apolgize and says that he wants to go the 5th district for his mission and 
        they talk more in depth about the classes (5) they go to the 5th district in secret they see a girl Titus fond of her guards come in to patrol they throw the girl 
        out they save her. Big tits teacher comes and says to not do it they are confronted by the director. They talk about the wizard/magician at Sindria. Later director 
        is doing lecture and he talks about how magicion are unfairly treated and that Titus can bring the girl they have fun but Magi sees that the director no longer see's 
        normal humans as humans but animals, later Titus is talking with the girl she says she will repay him back when she grows up. Titus is said to come back to where 
        he orginally came from from the Magi girl then he runs to the director and yells he wants to live. (/Ep 16) The girl Magi takes over tit's body and the director talk
        director, he refuses to give him back and so the Ren/Rem (idk) declare war against the magician country, Ren/Ram country arrived with boats and starts to attack 
        they use magic to defend they use bombs to destory the first of three barriers, magic country uses magic cannons to massacre the others, Alladin destory the tubes 
        connecting from the 5 th district, right then the red hair tribes arrive and they are having trouble, Magi then uses the flow of river to stop them but the red hair 
        people can swim but then Ms. Boobs uses electrictiy to electricfly all of them only 3 of them survived two of them uses their household vessal to break down the 2nd 
        barrier but then Alladin comes up and is getting all the power he makes 3 titans decompose them to make a river of sand sending the whole army back to the shores and
        says that he will push them back no matter how many times and all the soldiers are lost hope and seems like they gave up (/Ep 19) He goes into full body dijin equip
        and Alladin out magic hims he then uses one last moves to destroy the country then Goofy name comes and nullify the spell exhausted the red hair guy falls to the ground
        and calls him a traitor blah blah the Magi of their country comes out and says to cease fire and Goofy name, Alladin, tits, and girl Magi are in a about talking they
        talk about what Alladin fears the war and destruction that happened in another world, Goofy name enraged becasue he didn't tell earlier does the karate chop thingy on
        his head and says he should have said so way eariler and wants to help him for all his done for him. Tits is pulled on the side by girl Magi, girl Magi says that he should 
        go with Alladin and Goofy name becasue they only have a month to live because the original body is old and that both her and him are going to turn into Magoi. The director 
        then goes to the 5th district down the pit and unleashes the dark thingies against the Koi Empire, the 3rd prince is protecting them and the soldiers are saying that he is 
        their king, then Alibaba comes in and is about to use extreme magic (dafaq? Well ig he could) but the prince of Koi intercepts, with the prince their is 3 other guys 
        they have household items that makes them titan-sized the are now attacking the dark thingies, back at the magician country tits is talking with the little girl but 
        is talking like a old wise man and they go to out the pit and there he stops the director from the chaos but when he does tits is nothing but bones and the little girl
       is unconscious, director is stopped but the "furnance" the thing that is powering the black thingies is still sucking his Maoi and so he dies to, all the titan thingies 
       all disappear then some black ball thing from the sky with tens of hands is descending down, Alladin says it is what he saw in the other world and calls upon the Djinns 
       to show themselves and they talk with the prince, Magi says if he works together and stop it he will tell everything about the other world, prince agrees so he will know
       the secret of the world and can unify all people, it is explained from the Djinns that they the being is a high ranking deity from another dimension that shouldn't be in their
       world but is coming due to the black Magoi that has crystalized and they need to destroy the medium before the "evil" comes down and wipe everyone out they are fighting the 
       dark Djinns coming out of the sphere Alladin says they will need to kill about ~10k until the sphere runs out of Magoi and it's shield is down so we can attack it, 
       the Koi Empire prince goes in and tries to take all of it on his own and uses lava or smt to power him, and for some reason on 17:48 he gets all of that, prince grabs
       and says to help him beat the sphere they use both extreme magic to try and destroy the sphere (/Ep 23) yep they dont anime logic and so they are bamboozled one of his brother
       is using spatial magic to keep the flames under control, both of them goes to the volcano to replenish their Magoi suddenly the crystalized thing grows hand and takes away 
       the lava, all the dark djinns absorbs it and turns into a titan and takes away the fire tanggling him and the fire boys starts trying to attack but they cant do damage but 
       the sister can for some reason they then use the spatial magic user to transport all the Djinn magic vessal users to do a combo attack, prince heals both of them with Phoenix
       and go back in the fight they knock it into the water hoping they won but it comes back but even bigger, he stole the Ruth from the sea, they dont have any more extreme Magic
       Alladin is confident that they will win, by unifying themselves like did Solomon and his 72 household vessals, fight fight, they are seemingly losing with two of the Koi Empire
       prince and princess are damaged, spatial magic user transports a mountain on top of him but the thing is still alive, it uses like 10000 arms to reach out for, the now empress
       is actually apart of serving the "king" she is the magi and betrayed the king and it looks like the king is a girl? The thing reaches out to the thing in the sky and is pulling 
       it, stupid bitch says she will destroy the wishes of King Solomon or smt i forgor, so stupid bitch is trying to destroy this world because she couldn't in the orignal world.
       King Sinbad appears and brings along all the Metal users are their and it looks like it's about to be Avengers: End Game v2.0 I do not know any of this people dafaq. We then see
       the protecter of the valley in the red people tribe valley is there so Morg is there to, when goofy name falls down to exhasution he is caught by morg who can know fly because
       she can manipulate the fire on her chains, taught by the protecter of valley she rushes in the chaos, Sinbad does a speech about how they will destroy unwanted guest that 
       are trying to force themselves in their world and how their treaty is no conquering and not the be conquered (/Ep 24) They are fighting the beast when they are tired and 
       no Magoi the girl Magi sacirfices herself to give everyone Magoi, All metal users are using extreme magic, Sinbad uses extreme magic and their is a huge ass explosion
       it survives but their a white light in the thing, explain that the thing needs to be pure black ruth but their is a single light and it is tit, Alladin and the daughter
       go inside using Solomon wish and the black Magi is in the background saying that smt about the power that magi used that changed his life with another person next to him
       Inside director is inside a cage, tries to convince him to come back but he cant due to his sin of killing people. As his last wish he asks Alladin to figure out a way 
       to turn a black ruth into pure white ruth (also tit is stopping him from turning bad or smt) the daughter is having a little moment, blah blah, bro dafaq he cries 
       and his tears make the thing white and iced out, he is about to leave when he asks Alladin to relay a message to the people of his country that there is no race 
       stronger or better the then the other (tit is going to heaven) the monster exploses the daughter says she is sorry the medium in the sky disappears and everyone
       is happy, Alladin wakes up on the ground with the daughter crying then Alibaba and Morg picks him up and fist bump and then the Koi and Sinbad, Sinbad says that 
       the Rem Empire is a ally of the Seven Seas Alliance and they will be doing smt or another Koi claims Magi as theirs, everyone is happy, Back at Koi they are 
       happy that they made a huge dent in the world at Solomon's place he places a new Magi which is tit and everyone is happy, and in the background with the black 
       magi the black haired prince says he has betrayed them.

        SinBad Adventures a prequel to the Magi seris and is the story of Sinbad, added it here because I don't want to make a new page for it it starts with him being born 
        and everyone noticed due to the Magoi or smt saying he is a miracle child and the dad is a hero but he retired his nation against Rem the people have suffered because
        the war is harder then they thought since all the other wars were easy and gave bonuses and so the people were supportive of the war and called the dad a traitor due 
        to him not fighting blah blah a spy comes in their place but they didn't know dad kills him and is off to the war a month later they get his sword but not his body
        (/Ep 1) Sinbad now 14 is at some place or whateverthere is a group of merchant and they go into this village and some bandits popup Sinbad defeats them, he charms 
        the two girl but they don't need a bodyguard insteadthey give him some fruits, inside the barrel was the protecter of the valley who was a wondering explorer they

        the draft notes to the millitary, he is about to leavewhen the mother gives him his dad sword protecter says the power of a king or kings is in that tower and 
        disappears, at the tower they are taking roles and Sinbad isnt their and says that it's just one kid and they don't need him when he appears and goes in the tower 
        ahead of all the soldiers. All the soldiers are defeated and its just him and dragon guy they defeat mother dragon and insert 2 balls in the door (there was only 1)

        and is at home, he's been gone for 2 months when a lady comes up and says that his mother is dying he goes their and see's his mother at his last breath. His name is 
        known through out the land and is a sour taste in the mouth for nobility he for some reasons kipnaps the princess that the dragon dude likes and is off to change the 
        world in his ship. The world is in a era of dungeon. Sinbad is lost at sea when a brother and sister are fighitng a narwhale  when he tried to hit it, it doesnt inflict
        any damage so Sinbad uses his power and slays it. Dragul brother sends a Dragul with a elite assassains with to kill Sinbad for gettng to the tower first. The sister thinks 
        the brother killed the narwhale. Sinbad want to meet it's leader to learn more about the world. The leader says a dungeon appeared. And the leader agrees to not send anyone 
        there. There is a feast for the new warrior. THe assassains try to kill Sinbad, Sin counter attacks and gets him. The kid says that he killed his parents when he was 6
        and laughs about (also the cheif of the assassains) it, Sin slaps him (preach) Kid runs away. They leave the brother so he can calm his nerves but he really just went 
        to the dungeon. Sinbad follows him, they go insde the assassains also follows. Blah blah the magician is part of the old world they go to the Djinn catch a cat and they
        get power Sin gets him then the assassains turn into demon they defeat. Cheif goes to demon again Sin saves him, the bow to him as their master they go off the Reim to 
        be merchants and while they were arriving someone from the shawdows were looking at them. He sells stuff from the tribe. Some soldiers tell him needs permission from 
        the the union of merchant thingy but then shawdow people comes up and ask to buy it all later he resells it for 5-10x the value. Sin tells his crew to supply more on 
        items from the tribe. He talks with the shawdowy figure to learn the ins and out of the country and merchant to get the permit he needs 1000 gold coins and a letter

       escape Sin fights her he wins they are now in friendly terms they send a diplomat to follow they go to the headquarters the introduce themselves and have a feast (brother
       dude was having sex with all the girl ://) <br> Things I didn't metion in the first city they go he takes the the sword king or whatever to a remote place and showcase his 
       power and destroy mountains, Kid from the first city is a perv and wanted to escape the valley to have fun time with this girl she promised, brother wife was at her homeland
       when Sin returned and probably alot more stuff but damn this is all just 13 episodes the OVA is just a faster version for the lazy bums. <br> Score 6/10 average just Sinbad
