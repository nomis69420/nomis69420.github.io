        Magi: The Kingdom Of Magic has been on my watchlist for a few months now and I decided to watch it. Starts off where magi is overpowered as hell and 
        I'll just do a quick rundown on what happened, the princess dualed with sinbad and magi and the red hair girled and the prince went on a ship journey
        red hair girl is going to her homeland prince is idk. Alibaba is going to be coliseum to be more powerful magi is going to be stronger by going to a village 
        as they were about to arrived at the port, red hair girl sees fire in the port, then someone floating comes and demands for the stuff on the ship and 
        makes two ships float beside the ship all four were on and said they wer pirates. They have alladin as a hostage and succesfully got away with the loot from
        Sinbad's trading ship, later we find out they are kipnapping kids and adopt them with the loot they gained the other friends come to save Alladin, they 
        arrive and the prince is mad at Alababa because he thinks he was the one who destoryed his kingdom and took his mother or smt, as the enemy were running away 
        they get surronded by the naval ships and are attacked they get captured and then the prince executes her. Prince guy talks to the pirates and says that they 
        were just being used after he is seen about to go off on his own the red hair girl is there to ask him to not go and he confesses and they kiss imo he's 
        my favorite character. Goofy name cries as he asks the pirate to go to Sindria. All three are eating and they make a promsise to meet again. The boys goes 
        club. Goofy name meets ugly girl again. F for goofy name. The next day they are ready to leave and we see Alladin go on his carpet he get's tired and see's 
        carriage he asks to get on, he gives them ALL of his money from Sinbad and later we find out he's in the same carriage as the prince of the Koi Empire they 
        the prince has the power to make his sword like 10x bigger. He get's to the academy and he's the lowest 6 class and all he does is body training he survives 
        and he is more powerful we are then explained all 8 power thingies and he got fire power as his main and wind as his secoundar, tomorrow is the day for test 
        everyone is scared. Alladin goes and does a combination of fire and wind and gets promoted from bottom 6 class to top 1 class.Thanks to instructers boob :> 
        Next we see Goofy name, he is down on his lucks while he was traveling with his ship priates came along and he defended them the crew was actually on the same
        side as the pirates and so got Goofy name drunk then cleaned him out, he's out in the city and begging for food he then makes up his mind to go to the colosseum
        to become a gladiator he goes there and a girl is there asks for a entry mail or smt but he got cleaned out so she challenges him for entry gets his butt kicked
        since he's so hungry and then get's blasted off like team rocket where we see the 3 amigos (brothers) from S1 and they have a casino and they let him in while
        there he eats up and meets the master of the colosseum battles his apprentice (the girl from earlier) and wins he is now going to the colosseum to battle where
        they find out that there is two kind of ruth inside of him and if it continues it will damage his internal organs and now he needs to pay it off, so he is off 
        to fight the gorilla thingy that has taken the lives of 100 other gladiators. After getting beat hard by the gorilla he beats him and then one of his spirit thingies
        disappears uses the money to release the monster he talks with the master aout something then red
