        Magi: The Kingdom Of Magic has been on my watchlist for a few months now and I decided to watch it. Starts off where magi is overpowered as hell and 
        I'll just do a quick rundown on what happened, the princess dualed with sinbad and magi and the red hair girled and the prince went on a ship journey
        red hair girl is going to her homeland prince is idk. Alibaba is going to be coliseum to be more powerful magi is going to be stronger by going to a village 
        as they were about to arrived at the port, red hair girl sees fire in the port, then someone floating comes and demands for the stuff on the ship and 
        makes two ships float beside the ship all four were on and said they wer pirates. They have alladin as a hostage and succesfully got away with the loot from
        Sinbad's trading ship, later we find out they are kipnapping kids and adopt them with the loot they gained the other friends come to save Alladin, they 
        arrive and the prince is mad at Alababa because he thinks he was the one who destoryed his kingdom and took his mother or smt, as the enemy were running away 
        they get surronded by the naval ships and are attacked they get captured and then the prince executes her. Prince guy talks to the pirates and says that they 
        were just being used after he is seen about to go off on his own the red hair girl is there to ask him to not go and he confesses and they kiss imo he's 
        my favorite character. Goofy name cries as he asks the pirate to go to Sindria. All three are eating and they make a promsise to meet again. The boys goes 
        club. Goofy name meets ugly girl again. F for goofy name. The next day they are ready to leave and we see Alladin go on his carpet he get's tired and see's 
        carriage he asks to get on, he gives them ALL of his money from Sinbad and later we find out he's in the same carriage as the prince of the Koi Empire they 
        the prince has the power to make his sword like 10x bigger. He get's to the academy and he's the lowest 6 class and all he does is body training he survives 
        and he is more powerful we are then explained all 8 power thingies and he got fire power as his main and wind as his secoundar, tomorrow is the day for test 
        everyone is scared. Alladin goes and does a combination of fire and wind and gets promoted from bottom 6 class to top 1 class.Thanks to instructers boob :> 
        Next we see Goofy name, he is down on his lucks while he was traveling with his ship priates came along and he defended them the crew was actually on the same
        side as the pirates and so got Goofy name drunk then cleaned him out, he's out in the city and begging for food he then makes up his mind to go to the colosseum
        to become a gladiator he goes there and a girl is there asks for a entry mail or smt but he got cleaned out so she challenges him for entry gets his butt kicked
        since he's so hungry and then get's blasted off like team rocket where we see the 3 amigos (brothers) from S1 and they have a casino and they let him in while
        there he eats up and meets the master of the colosseum battles his apprentice (the girl from earlier) and wins he is now going to the colosseum to battle where
        they find out that there is two kind of ruth inside of him and if it continues it will damage his internal organs and now he needs to pay it off, so he is off 
        to fight the gorilla thingy that has taken the lives of 100 other gladiators. After getting beat hard by the gorilla he beats him and then one of his spirit thingies
        disappears uses the money to release the monster he talks with the master aout something then red girl is going to her homeland she meets the stupi king from the other 
        kingdom and his brother they are studying a groyp of people for Sindria because their language is seen alot in dungeons. Red hair is going to her homeland she has to 
        cross a valley and so she does by getting down with her chain then running when she reeachs the ground, she runs until she finds a house inside is the "guardian" of 
        valley and says he can bring her to her homeland but she can't comeback. Also he says the world will fall into a destructive war. At the Koi Empire the emperor died 
        all of his kids are going to respect him theyre the annouce the next ruler which is the wife. Homie says he respect her but in truth will kill her i think and explains 
        his big plain to his sister. But she says she have to think about it. Then we see the Magi and the empress (bitch) and they have a little fight and Homie loses Magi says 
        if he were to direct his anger to his destiny he would gladed take him. Next Alladin we see him at a ceremony where he is on par with someone in the class 1 thing 
        When other guy asked if Alladin wanted to be friends but Alladin proceeds to roast him about his high voice and his butt is big and touched his chest for boobs 
        but he's a guy. Then the ruler of the place their at says they need to have a duel because advanced magic is something and only one of them is allowed to be 
        educated. They are sparing and they rip off each other's sleeves revealing the stone that Alladin was supposed to keep away at all cost but he also had one 
        in his arms. The ruler came down and declared the match is a draw. Alladin tried talking to him but other guy took his hand and was about to kill Alladin for 
        he will be problem in his mission the leader stops it and Alladin is in a bed healing while other guy is in solitude. Near the end we see him talking to someone 
        on his arms. The queen (or princess) where Alibaba is at. (end of ep 13) Titus later apolgize and says that he wants to go the 5th district for his mission and 
        they talk more in depth about the classes (5) they go to the 5th district in secret they see a girl Titus fond of her guards come in to patrol they throw the girl 
        out they save her. Big tits teacher comes and says to not do it they are confronted by the director. They talk about the wizard/magician at Sindria. Later director 
        is doing lecture and he talks about how magicion are unfairly treated and that Titus can bring the girl they have fun but Magi sees that the director no longer see's 
        normal humans as humans but animals, later Titus is talking with the girl she says she will repay him back when she grows up. Titus is said to come back to where 
        he orginally came from from the Magi girl then he runs to the director and yells he wants to live. (/Ep 16)
