        Ship and nami is in it the ship get's attacked by big mama they get on board and nami goes to their ship and steals their stuff. 
        Luffy is inside a barrel pops out and defeats big mama and escapes with Kobe they just drift around and find a village where
        zoro is at. Zoro protect girls from ballsack guy and haves to survive for 30 days. Luffy gets his sword back and gives it to
        zoro. Then Luffy defeats axe guy then convices to make him join his crew the marine people are happy, Kobe becomes a marine 
        during that Nami was stealing their paper or smt. They were drifting around again when they saw a bird and was going to eat it
        but Luffy get's carried off with the bird cause it was big and Nami is there and Buggy the clown. Nami tries to join the Buggy
        crew then dog gives beast smoke and they are fighting Buggy (Shanks protecs Luffy from sea monster get's his arm cut off). 
        Buggy loses and Nami joins Luffy (we get backstory on buggy and shanks that Buggy got scared from Shanks and accidently ate 
        the chop chop fruit and couldn't the treasure below the sea) They run off after the citiziens arrive and the mayor thanks them
        as they sail off (they also give them half of the treasure 5m berries) They drift around and arrive at a village and there 
        Big nose is there they find out that a rich girl with a disease is there and big nose lies to her about his adventures to feel 
        better, Luffy thinks they they will give them a ship so they trespassed the walls and try to talk when her butler arrive which
        the butler says that she shouldn't meet with big nose anymore blah shit goes down big nose and luffy overhears the butler and 
        a pirate planning her death so he can have her fortune for 3 years he waited for this. Big nose tries to warn the village but 
        they ignore him. They prepare for them but they arrive on the oppsite side of the island. Micheal has the power to hipnotize 
        (future me reading this I skipped alot cause github.dev decided to delete my work). Micheal makes them stronger. LMAO THEY GOT
        LUFFY STRONGER. Luffy starts massacering the pirates, Luffy falls asleep. Rich girl finds the other butler and finds out the 
        other butler tried to murder him and finds out the butler is indeed a pirate. The pirates still have a trump card but they 
        don't want to, they force the trump cards to fight. Green hair is actually skilled and the other one is heavy and is strong 
        (Luffy is stick under a pole after eliminating the small-frys) the butler appears, the two brothers try to attack him but he 
        disappears and beats them black and blue. Luffy wakes up with the help from Nami. Rich grl appears and pulls a gun on him, they 
        talk, Butler takes gun and Luffy one taps him to the ground the 3 kids start bashing him whilst he's on the ground. Micheal is 
        tasked to kill Taya and big nose tells the kids and Taya to run away. Zoro fighting with fatso and beats him with *style*.
        Luffy and Zoro will defeat butler nevermind Zoro and big nose run off to find Taya. Luffy fights butler. Butler is winning 
        when we find out that he left the pirates to have peace of mind and made a fake die in order for him to live. Micheal cutting 
        trees to catch em. Butler was going to kill his crew to erase his identity. After getting slapped around by Luffy he doews a 
        technique. The three kids try to attack Micheal since he found them but makes Taya (holy shit i just found that her name is Kaya)
        sign the will. Butler technique which scares the other pirates which all it does makes him so fast that he just slices randomly 
        Luffy still gets him but he goes back to his technique. When Kaya finished the will when she about to be poop, Zoro comes in and 
        intervene the kill (/Ep 16) They defeat Micheal with the slingshot, Luffy defeats Butleer and makes the pirates run away. Big 
        nose says he gonna be a pirate and haevs an inspirational speech with the kids. They promise not to tell anyone about the pirate
        raid in the village, but the villages are feeling weird when big nose doesn't go around shouting. Shit is wholesome fr fr. Big 
        nose is invited aong with the crew :D they sail off wih the 3 kids watching. We then get a backstory on big nose and his mother 
        was sick and was waiting for his dad which was part of the shanks crew so he would go around shouting in hopes of his father 
        coming back. Mother probably died 3 days later. Luffy and Zoro and Nami I think invite big nose and he's happy. When the ship
        leaevs the three kid decide to do what big nose did to carry on the legacy. (/Ep 17) On the ship big nose is a artist and 
        draws the iconic strawhat pirate logo. And they head toward treasure island. There they hear a "god" but really it's just
        some gomba in a chest, he protects the six chest when he found them 20 years ago Luffy asks to go get them, but there are 
        empty. They invite gommba to their crew but he declines and says with his animal friends. The crew sets off once again 
        (this ark was war less longer then the previous one) <br> <br> Two Piece Movie 1 : <br> Notes : color on this is a bit wacky. <br>
        Starts off about a story about a guy who had alot of gold and hid it away on a island a kid is also looking for it. Luffy and Zoro 
        are hungry when some thieves steal Nami's treasure Luffy tries to stop them when another captain uses a lazerbeam thingy. The thieves
        swim away so Zoro and Luffy are left with a kid, they paddle to a shop where they eat alot. Luffy tries to eat and run but couldn't 
        and is locked up, Nami in the enemy ship guess she sneaked up, arrived at the island. Big nose is also there but is captured and lies 
        about knowing where the treasure is. Luffy and Zoro are still stuck together, little boy wants to be a pirate or smt. The people who 
        took Nami treasure supposedly killed off all of Woonan's crew and the last one had the map to the island, also the captain really 
        really likes gold. Captain has a elite troop of some sort and pays 4 gold for him to destroy a landslide. Nami and big nose lie to 
        to them about the gold being under the gate if they dig so the captain uses his devil powers to dig. Luffy and Zoro try to protect 
        the kid because he looks up to the gold pirate (for clarification the gold pirate is the legendary pirate with alot of gold) and is 
        trying to protect his base Luffy and Zoro are still tied up. They get sent flying to the whale statue. Nami frees the duo and use's 
        fire to see invisible ink on the map but burns it. They see the real castle. I predicted that the ocean shop owner would be Woonan 
        but we see him near the real castle (for clarification the enemy pirates are at a fake castle they are heading towards the REAL base) 
        Shop owner says he kknew him cause when they were younger they were at the same village. Some flashbacks we see them fighting over which 
        is more important gold or oden. One wants to get all the gold in the world other wants to make oden and show the world or smt. They are 
        on a cliff when oden guy sacirifce himself for his friend. A nereby ship saved his life. Woonan leaves. Oden guy wants to give Woonan his 
        oden. They go in a hut at the top of the mountain thing. Zoro finds a passage but the other pirates are there to. They step on the oden guys oden >:(
        Luffy eats off the floor. Zoro and the gold paided person are going at it. Zoro defeats him saying that come back when he has pride with his sword instead of gold or smt
        Luffy throws him up but dude uses his beam in the air to get him. Luffy dodges and uses his head but he is still alive. And use's a beam, Luffy gets his belly big to reflect
        it. Then finishes him off with a a bazooka. The other pirates run awau and they finally go inside the passage. They open a doorand see Woonan's skeleton sitting and there
        is writing on the walls saying that he returned all the gold that he stole and that it was the adventure of finding the gold. And yeah
        after the crew is getting ready to leave.. Nami takes el draco (lmao finally I find his name) treasure and leave. Oden dude and lil kid watch 
        <br> Nah fr this movie is honestly good I gave it a 9 on MAL because of it's joke which I didn't write def rewatch it when I finish three piece. Love it, not much more I can say.
