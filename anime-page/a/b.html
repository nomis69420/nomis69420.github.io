        see's a monster a sixed eyed one that looks humongous. They say it's the spirit of the Alpeca because the murderer hasn't 
        been found yet. The deer guy comes back after 2 months and turns in a resignation form and then he is with the wolf-girl and 
        she begs to actually reject her and not like last time when he spout out nonsense. He tried to comfort her and says they should 
        go to the wolf place while there they wolves there say that the herbavoires, later we find out it was a freshman who was pulling 
        a prank, but Legoshi is hearing this "shh" sound for a while now and thinks that someone is spying on them, he goes to a barren 
        place in which he demands the thing that been looking at them to come out and which it does. Legoshi is suprised (/EP 1)
