        says that he'll get his microscope. He goes and see's a monster a sixed eyed

        murderer hasn't been found yet. The deer guy comes back after 2 months and 
        turns in a resignation form and then he is with the wolf-girl and she begs

        there they wolves there say that the herbavoires, later we find out it was 
        a freshman who was pulling a prank, but Legoshi is hearing this "shh" sound
        for a while now and thinks that someone is spying on them, he goes to a 
        barren place in which he demands the thing that been looking at them to come
        out and which it does. Legoshi is suprised (/EP 1)
