        see's a monster a sixed eyed one that looks humongous. They say it's the spirit of the Alpeca because the murderer hasn't 
        been found yet. The deer guy comes back after 2 months and turns in a resignation form and then he is with the wolf-girl and 
        she begs to actually reject her and not like last time when he spout out nonsense. He tried to comfort her and says they should 
        go to the wolf place while there they wolves there say that the herbavoires, later we find out it was a freshman who was pulling 
        a prank, but Legoshi is hearing this "shh" sound for a while now and thinks that someone is spying on them, he goes to a barren 
        place in which he demands the thing that been looking at them to come out and which it does. Legoshi is suprised (/EP 1)

        Legoshi is training not to go to his instincts when smelling meat, He is worn out has a tough schedule talking to panda dude 
        at the club pretty boy asks what wrong, Legosi dodges the question and is showing the costumes and such then he smells a femine
        seemingly coming from pretty boy, pretty boy says he got slapped by his gf and asks if Legosi has a gf or a crush he is then
        reminded of Haru, pretty boy says to eat him Lego says no he goes to the cafeteria for veggies. Bro idk episode 6 Louis is at
        gunpoint with his adoptaive father and is telling him to sign the sheet of paper for resignation he meets up wth the herb

        Legosi says that they all had lives and all animals are equal panda guy says that he has cleared the first hurdle at school 
        he falls asleep whilst thinking about his bad grades, Haru shows up they talk about what happened list night and why Legosi been
        ignoring her text, looking away from her at schoool, etc etc, she is mad and is lonely without Legosi, Legosi suggest marraige 
        Haru says no, but seesm to like him later they are doing a jaw battle strength contest Legosi loss by a mile probably due to 
        the training later he drinks the drinks of all the carnivores in the club (lmao dafaq) and it's the brown bear (but he's white)
        they are talking when the black panther accidentally rips of the aardvark hands there the black panther is scared saying it was on
        accident and the aardvark says that he doesn't want any carnivores to get near him but Legosi so Legosi picks him to the nurse's 
        office with the brown bear (white) carrying his arms in a school warps shirt as they are outside the nurses office Legosi confronts
        him and the bear he'll have to eliminate Legosi and starts scratching the ceiling (dafaq he tall as shit) Legosi is scared and can't
        move then pretty boy comes to give the aardvark his stuff he overhears the conversation and talk he says have fun with sleepless nights 
        and he bear takes meds becasue he is to strong honey stops the side effects and we get a flashbak to when Tem was a alive. Tem and Bear 
        talk, they get to know each other one day Bear decides to not take his med so he can see the real him and eats him. Read comments and 
        apparently when Tem said that all carnivores were a monster everything after that was just hallucinations. Shit just got dark as hell

        wholesome moment  Legoshi is caught by the Leo group thinking he was eating other people, after some talking they all eat and talk. Legoshi tells Louis he knows who killed Tem. At school bear goes on about protecting herbavoires or something Legoshi is enraged and tries to confront him but fails. Bear is delusional thinking that he killed Tem for friendship or something and he is going to eliminate 
        Logo and Pina if they dont shut up. Next episode (idk which) he is having dirty dreams about Haru when she appears they go someplace else to talk. Pretty boy is threatend by the bear and leaes a note in his locker Legosi trying to stop it get's suprised punched from bear dude and they start going at it (epic shit) they agree to end this on on new years eve. The day before Legosi asks to get stronger

Lego dressed as a girl to meet Louis (dafaq actually tho why there is absolutly no reason there were no guards or anything, NADA)
        they talk about the bear dude being the murderer Louis says call the goddamn polic like fr tho but Lego wanna be mr tuff guy and fight him and asks Louis to watch him fight. Back at school we see Pina talking to bear, Pina tries to catch him in 4k about him being the murderer but fails and bear may or may not have killed, Legosi thanks panda. Louis going to leave the leo group for some reason, Ibuki drives and 
        stops in a tunnel and where he was about to eat him, Louis had the chance to shoot him as Ibuki was about to eat him outside the car the dude that Ibuki said was to shoot him if he ever tried to eat Louis shot him. Legosi (alr shit fuck it) arrvies bear dude has blood but pina didnt die they fight then have a pause for some reason they resume then Louis appears they run away, Legosi eats one of Louis's legs they fight,
