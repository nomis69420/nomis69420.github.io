    <h3 class="s1">86 is a story about a force called the legion they are mechs and in season 1 there is 86 district and those with white hair and blue eyes are 
    allowed in the 85 district which is safe from harm but the people who are colored hair eyes etc are forced to fight on the battlefield protecting
    the 85 district with mechs the main character is a girl named Millize she is assigned a new batch of 86 to command which is the ace 86 with someone named undertaker
    she believe's that 86 are human and should not be killed in the battlefield like so and so she wants to get to know them and she later finds out that 
    undertaker has the power to read minds and finds out that the legion are people that have died on the battlefield and use's their brain to control
    legion? Later one of there comrades die and everything is tense she gets confronted when she says shell treat them human but didn't even ask for 
    there name. The captain later starts asking for their name and everyone is cool skip a few episodes and there numbers are reduced from i think 25~ to just 5
    and there she finds out that the 86 are in a deathhole and that they were promised after 6 years the would be free but the is a mission which is to send 86 
    in legion territory and to keep going until they die, captain Millize then tries to stop them from going but they believe dying is freedom and will continue 
    to march forward (forgot to mention that undertaker is Shin and he has survived through many camps that he whenever a friend of hsi dies he carves a piece of 
    there mech and keeps them in a box so when he dies they follow along just like a reaper) and once they 5 are off to their mission captain Millize goes to their camp 
    since she is under house arrest for using bombs to help the 86 while in battle and there she finds a picture of everyone with there names and promise to catch up
    to them </h3> 
    <h3 class="s1d">Overall good anime in comments they talked about how animation is silky smooth and ig yeah I gave it a 8/10 on MAL so yeah hopefully it keeps the consistency
    for S2</h3>
    <h3 class="s2">S2 of 86 - so when they sent on their speacial mission to go into region territory and not come back they had kept going and on the way they have a break and they
    clean up their stuff and while they are they talk about freedom and what's it like, they pack up and get ready to go as they are going there mechs are all destoryed but
    Shin's so they have a schedule on who get's to get in on Shin's mech while the other four are on Fido unexpectedly Shin's ask to get on the mech because he was "bored" but 
    goes ahead without them to fight the Legion coming their way as Shin is fighting it seems like he is about to lose when the 4 friends try to attack with there guns they defeated
    the Legion and get knocked out, Shin finds himself in a white room afterwards someone comes in with a gas suit and says that their in another Nation or smt and they found
    knocked out and retrieved them and gave them hospitality later finds out that he is the representive of the Nation and says he'll adopt them and stuff so the 5 are now in 
    the guys house and there is a little girl there lmao I forgor her name and finds out that she was the Queen of some sort of the past Legion but they gone bersek or smt
    and stuff. The 5 go on to do what they like for example the vice-commander guy is doing truck-driving the white haired is cooking drawing boy is drawing girl who has a 
    crush on Shin is shopping and Shin is at the libary there he meets this dude and stuff the 5 then decide enough they have rested enough and says they should be getting 
    out on the battlefield the guy who adopted them said they should'nt as they are kids but they still insist he says they should join the millitary or something so they 
    freedom or smt and stuff stuff they are in the millitary Shin is luietent or captain there they do some stuff and Shin then tells them that a huge huge army of Legion is 
    heading their way after a little a blast destorys a millitary building and as it turns out it's like a railgun of some sort and has the range to destroy nations so they 
    decide that Shin and his friends should go skip alot of fights and later it's Shin versus the railgun the others are trying to fend of Legion while they were crossing 
    so they left someone behind to take care of it turns out little sister girl is there and that railgun is her prince or smt and distracts him while Shin finishes him off 
    stuff stuff later and ths is pretty awesome but the commander way back in s1 appears in front of Shin not knowing that it's him they talk and after a while they part ways
    still not knowing it was Shin, a episode later they meet up and cries since she didn't know who they were uptill now end of S2 and ima be honest there is def going to be a
    S3 so yeah
    before i forget i didnt mention that girl back then because she was a little annoying and overall didn't have much to do with the story imo</h3>
