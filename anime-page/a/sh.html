    <h3 class="s1">Shield Hero 2 is a the prequel to Shield Hero and I'll be honest I had good hopes for it since I enjoyed first season pretty good and boy did it crash and burn
    so it starts off with them in the midle of nowhere in a village and some random ass people there and yada yada and some bats starts attacking them and they are called to the Queen
    also forgot to mention that there is a green hair girl named whoever dafaq knows follows Naofumi while they were going to the Queen they discuss about a legend about a ginormous
    turtle going on the ravampage due to shift in power or something i forgot so they have to take care of it the other heroes don't want to since they say that they are only there to
    take care of the wave, they meet a woman who they find out later is the vessal of the spirit turtle, also they find out later that a science guy is behind this and is controlling 
    turtle and of course he's a bad guy they defeat him with the help of green hair bitch (I hate her because she wants to get in the bow heroe's pants like dafaq she was so useless 
    they kicked her out and now she still likes him even tho she's with Naofumi bro go with your botfriend instead of Naofumi) anyways they defeat him and finds out they were using the
    other hero's power to power up his spirit turtle or smt so yada yada beat him and he escapes to another dimensions from where he's from and there he goes to the labyrinth of smt where
    Kizuna is and she's the smt hero and stuff they beat him again after they track where Filo is. They beat him and are sent back to their world and is sentoff from Kizuna and glass and 
    the others.
    </h3> 
    <h3 class="s1d">Total bummer,</h3>
    <h3 class="s2">S2 of 86 - so when they sent on their speacial mission to go into region territory and not come back they had kept going and on the way they have a break and they
    clean up their stuff and while they are they talk about freedom and what's it like, they pack up and get ready to go as they are going there mechs are all destoryed but
    Shin's so they have a schedule on who get's to get in on Shin's mech while the other four are on Fido unexpectedly Shin's ask to get on the mech because he was "bored" but 
    goes ahead without them to fight the Legion coming their way as Shin is fighting it seems like he is about to lose when the 4 friends try to attack with there guns they defeated
    the Legion and get knocked out, Shin finds himself in a white room afterwards someone comes in with a gas suit and says that their in another Nation or smt and they found
    knocked out and retrieved them and gave them hospitality later finds out that he is the representive of the Nation and says he'll adopt them and stuff so the 5 are now in 
    the guys house and there is a little girl there lmao I forgor her name and finds out that she was the Queen of some sort of the past Legion but they gone bersek or smt
    and stuff. The 5 go on to do what they like for example the vice-commander guy is doing truck-driving the white haired is cooking drawing boy is drawing girl who has a 
    crush on Shin is shopping and Shin is at the libary there he meets this dude and stuff the 5 then decide enough they have rested enough and says they should be getting 
    out on the battlefield the guy who adopted them said they should'nt as they are kids but they still insist he says they should join the millitary or something so they 
    freedom or smt and stuff stuff they are in the millitary Shin is luietent or captain there they do some stuff and Shin then tells them that a huge huge army of Legion is 
    heading their way after a little a blast destorys a millitary building and as it turns out it's like a railgun of some sort and has the range to destroy nations so they 
    decide that Shin and his friends should go skip alot of fights and later it's Shin versus the railgun the others are trying to fend of Legion while they were crossing 
    so they left someone behind to take care of it turns out little sister girl is there and that railgun is her prince or smt and distracts him while Shin finishes him off 
    stuff stuff later and ths is pretty awesome but the commander way back in s1 appears in front of Shin not knowing that it's him they talk and after a while they part ways
    still not knowing it was Shin, a episode later they meet up and cries since she didn't know who they were uptill now end of S2 and ima be honest there is def going to be a
    S3 so yeah
    before i forget i didnt mention that girl back then because she was a little annoying and overall didn't have much to do with the story imo</h3>
