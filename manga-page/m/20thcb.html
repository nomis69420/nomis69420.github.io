      at their old base Otcho makes kanna hear the radio which is a continuation of Kenii's song and decides to cancell the riot. The so called aliien is corner and comes out dude sings
      the soldiers fire, dude has a huge ass fan and everyone follows him, he goes on the road again. Kanna and Otcho are informed that all of their friends had died or arrested they go 
      to the hideout and is captured bu the new friend faction brought to the vice guy and asks to kill friend he tells a storu. Dude brodcast the song in a remote place where everyone 
      else had died. Maruo and Happy guy aks a guy to find the broadcast orgins and then shows them a tape about the vice guy. Vice story is when some guys knock on his pffoce and asks
      which masks he likes laying down all of friends mask and asks about the example project, On the tape we see a program about kids and all they annoucned that next week they will 
      have a kid with spoon bending powers right before broadcast they say its fake and discontiue the program forever, Kid friend wants to take over the world and kill the people that 
      tease him later vice says that he heard friend say in a soft voice "if i were (friends name) what would i do?" We see police boy and dude go to a town but to get to tokyo they need 
      permits they get it from one of the manga dudes but police boy gets ratted out by cowboy. After dude get's passed all the gates he comes back and makes manga boy make 200 for the 
      whole village they get in. dude wants to save police boy other dudes join including cowboy at night he goes by himself and talks to the guy who let them in tokyo also known as long
      hair boy. turns out he killed kenji sisters husband and made the robot and had the men with suitcases. Kanna mother is testing a new vaccine and if she dies in the next 24 hours man
      kind loses, idk what happened either my memory is stupid or I skipped a whole volume but now police boy and Kenji are talking they talk about the world expo and how on the day the pope
      was there police boy and the italian priest went inside the giant sun thingy and saw a 2 or 1 kid playing saying "lets plaaay Kenji-kun" or smt like that. Cowboy and the crew comes back
      saying that there is a sewage drain maybe connecting to Tokyo also police boy and Kenji are with a whole bunch of people who follows Kenji cause if his little music. Two kids are playing 
      when one of them overthrows a ball when a so-called alien shows up, Kanna is at a church confessing when strong girl appears and say that she wouldn't be able to face Kenji if something
      bad happened to her. We see that friend wants to move to Mars and stuff. God is bankrupted and stuff. Wants to see highschool girl bring back bowling and the girl is challenging someone
      else. Apparntly friend is going to kill off humans with a virus sprayed down from UFO's Kanna figures out that the world expo grounds is the only safe place. Frog dude and Maruo are 
      talking that frog dude ran away when Yanbo and Mabo found there base and that Maruo cried turns out both of them did the opposite, frog dude's son takes down the frog flag and plants a 
      the friend symbol saying that they'll take back that symbol. Glasses meet up with Yanbo and Mabo they talk about the fight way long ago. Friend is saying that the last page of the new 
      prophecy is today and goes down to a broadcast and asks to air a player. Kanna and the crew see the tv on tv Friend is there and says that he created all of it the virus the UFO's and
      will destroy it in one week like god did and says Kenji to plaaay. After 2 days since Friend tv show everyone is locked up in their homes knowing that Friend was behind the Bloody Eve 
      of 2000 and the virus seems like Kanna crew is trying to get everyone inside the world expo. Kanna inside a what seems to be a broadcast station sees the dude who tried to assainate the 
      Pope with his radio friend they got there by the helicopter which I'm guessing he stole to get away from the Pope. The grocery girl is trying to put a speaker so everyone can hear Kenji's 
      song but I think everyone is else is doing that and can hear Kennji songs in all the homes. At the broadcast station the dj dude says the he saw Kenji gave him aid and recorded the song 
      and finds out that he was also one of the kids back in the day Konichi he says on the mic that alot of bands will be playing in the world expo free of charge in hopes of trying to get 
      everyone there. At friend headquarters they talk about the message Friend said. People that Kanna knew like the gambling dude waaay back see's it, Highschool girl and Kanna are going 
      to bands to sing up on the stage like that rock bang the highschool girl liked and the Hello Hello guy but he declines because his songs are praising Friend. Yessir the Hello Hello guy 
      goes to recruit on of the band members from Kenji old band. Kanna mother goes to a hospital and makes the docter take the vaccine and stuff. Frog man Maruo and his son are going to 
      Tokyo to give the vaccine when in front of the gate inside Tokyo frog man goes up to them saying they got the vaccine. The guards make him stand on a big "x" on the ground and tries 
      to shoot him they dip wth Maruo and his son (note - They were bodies lying on the side of the street when they got there, also the vaccine was in the car but they had to leave it, the 
      guards end up shooting the car) All 3 jumped in what seems to be a sewer and inside there's a bunch of kids with the the toy mask. Kanna was going to knock down the gate inside the world
      expo but the guards allow it after the Hello Hello guy shows up. In the sewer the kids with mask brings them to the "Masked King" and they have the vaccine, Maruo gives the kid the vaccine
      the Masked King brings them along to the wall where they see poles sticking out of the wall. Turns out it was Otcho who did that and that's how he got it. They get up with the help of a rope
      Maruo invites the Masked King turns out he is Sadakiyo. Nice. Glasses dude is telling his crew that whenever they feel dangered run away. Apprantly there is a spy among them, The boy girl 
      (The now new vice secrety of dick head shit) Is interveiwing what I presume the spy?? Otcho, God, and the robot builder are talking ig they gonna use the giant robot to fight or smt. <br>
      I should have said this long ago but this is the last volume of 20th Century Boys there is 21st Century Boys but idk if I can handle it tbh <br>
      SHIT someone took the fucking remote AHHHHHHHHHH Otcho goes after it. Police boys goes to the former police guy who killed his grandpa they talk and the police captain says that the report in 
      which the now friend is in the sun in the world expo to keep it hidden. Ho man so Kanna is preparing the giant robot is freaking everyone out. Glasses man is storming friend building.
      They get in with ease due the employers being sad and all. Kanna fainted so is being rushed to the apartments and what not. Maruo and drog dude see's Kenji infront of the robot I think Friend Is
      inside of it, also the UFO's are already flying around. Maruo and Kenji and the cartoon guy go in a truck a kid sneaks in. Frog dude is sent to the city to deliver the vaccine. Someone on the car
      radio tells them directions they end up in front of Maruo shop and they head to the school dude dafaq Friend is there and is going to kill Kanna who is sleeping in the apartments with the robot 
      saying Kenji is evil, Kenji is seeming to be bowing. Shit is happening bro shit is happening.. #13 crashes into a UFO Kenji is up on stage and won't sing the song apprantly he is going to confess

      <section class="S2">21 CENTURY BOYS - <br> <br> 
      Friend died or the new one I should say, if your reading this like a year later on July 20 2022 than 
      you probably won't understad what I'm saying but Sadakiyo got a badge from the winning paper an Kenji 
      stole one and apprantly future Kenji went in the past to see old Kenji, Kenji is slowing regoruping 
      with everyone, fast forward the UN is in Japan and Kenji is talking to a profiler and they say that 
      they will send some elite forces inside the Virtual Attraction and says at the last page of the New 
      Book of Prophecy there will be a anti-proton bomb that will destory the world, Kenji says that he 
      needs to go inside the Virtual Machine instead of the forces since he will understand what's going 
      on. The crew is eating and having a celebration Kanna next to Sadakiyo since she feels like she was 
      the one to blame for the things that have happened(/Ch 4) Ig Kenji liked Yukiji and all and is now 
      off to the virtual machine he goes in and talks to his former self about the anti-proton thingy, 
      everything is based off manga- but new problem is the anti bomb, inside the long hair dude is still 
      there and can't exit causes he's body is already dead they talk and find out that the kid with the 
      mask (Sadakiyo I think) put the anti-proton bomb in the expo there, a team is searching for the bomb 
      when they shine a light on it they see the friend symbol. Police boy and the former police captan talk 
      about how his grandpa died and how the grandpa literally figured out who was his identity and more lmao, 
      Sadakiyo is in the ICU stuff is going. I think Sadakiyo was wrongly blamed for stealing the badge. Kanna 
      and police boy are outside
