    <h3>86 is a story about a force called the legion they are mechs and in season 1 there is 86 district and those with white hair and blue eyes are 
    allowed in the 85 district which is safe from harm but the people who are colored hair eyes etc are forced to fight on the battlefield protecting
    the 85 district with mechs the main character is a girl named Millize she is assigned a new batch of 86 to command which is the ace 86 with someone named undertaker
    she believe's that 86 are human and should not be killed in the battlefield like so and so she wants to get to know them and she later finds out that 
    undertaker has the power to read minds and finds out that the legion are people that have died on the battlefield and use's their brain to control
    legion? Later one of there comrades die and everything is tense she gets confronted when she says shell treat them human but didn't even ask for 
    there name. The captain later starts asking for their name and everyone is cool skip a few episodes and there numbers are reduced from i think 25~ to just 5
    and there she finds out that the 86 are in a deathhole and that they were promised after 6 years the would be free but the is a mission which is to send 86 
    in legion territory and to keep going until they die, captain Millize then tries to stop them from going but they believe dying is freedom and will continue 
    to march forward (forgot to mention that undertaker is Shin and he has survived through many camps that he whenever a friend of hsi dies he carves a piece of 
    there mech and keeps them in a box so when he dies they follow along just like a reaper) and once they 5 are off to their mission captain Millize goes to their camp 
    since she is under house arrest for using bombs to help the 86 while in battle and there she finds a picture of everyone with there names and promise to catch up
    to them </h3>
